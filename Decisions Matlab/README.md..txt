This does Matlab problem solving with volume in tank problem. 
*Inside the tank there is a float that indicates the level of the water. Write a MATLAB program that determines the volume of the water in the tank from the position (height h) of the float. 
If you were doing this problem in real life, the program should ask the user to enter a value of h in m using the input() funtion.
